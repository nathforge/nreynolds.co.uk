<p style="font-size: 120%">
    I need Hallmark's Christmas movie schedule (for marriage-related reasons)
</p>

- **Option 1**: copy/paste movie listings from a website. 😴
- **Option 2**: spend $20 on an LLM and reverse engineer an Android app for fun.

Given my aversion to [unboiled water](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=ai+is+boiling+the+ocean) *the choice is clear*.<br>

Let’s grab the [Hallmark APK](https://www.google.com/search?q=hallmark+movie+checklist+apk+download) and have at it.

Android apps are generally easier to reverse than the iOS equivalent. Open platform, bytecode, etc.

I've [written about reverse engineering Android apps](/blog/reverse-engineering-the-latitude-festival-app) the hard(er) way.

How it went down with Claude code:

> Hey Claude, I want to reverse engineer this Android app for which I lost the source code 😉.
> The xapk is in this directory. Give me readable code to work with.

It output Java files! I expected [Smali](https://www.google.com/search?q=smali+code) but it used a [decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) 👌

The files are obfuscated - minified names etc. That’s fine, it takes longer to read through but still achievable.

_Or_ - throw more LLM at it.

**Hey, Claude:**

> List the API endpoints called from this decompiled Android app.
> Figure out how authentication works.

🤖 `POST auth/create - Register device`<br>
🤖 `GET app/franchise/{id} - Get franchise details`<br>
*… and so on*

👍

<p>&nbsp;</p>

> Create example typescript demonstrating the signup process.
> My email is redacted@gmail.com.<br>
> You can suffix the username with “+” and a random number for testing.
> Run the signup script. Verify the signup endpoint returns a successful response.

🤖 `The API responded. It's returning a 400 error because the field names are different. Let me look at the actual User entity structure and update the script.`<br>
🤖 `The API expects name and surname instead of firstName and lastName.`<br>
🤖 `The signup endpoint is working successfully! Let me create an enhanced version of the script with better documentation and add a confirmation script as well.`

<hr/>

<aside>
<div class="aside-icon">🤔</div>
<div>
    Hallmark signup sends <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=magic+link+auth">a magic link</a> for email confirmation.<br>
    It <em>also</em> includes the confirmation link in the signup API response - so it's trivial to bypass email confirmation.<br>
</div>
</aside>

<hr/>

> I noticed the signup API returns a confirmation URL. Can we use that to complete signup? Provide a script that does so.

🤖 `The confirmation body needs id, deviceId,
  and confirmationToken. Let me look for how to generate a device ID.`<br>
🤖 `The confirmation worked (200 OK) but the response format is different.
  Let me check what we got back.`<br>
🤖 `The script successfully obtained a working JWT access token valid for ~1 year, and
  verified it works by successfully calling the authenticated /app/settings endpoint.`

💁 Neat.

<hr/>

> [That is fantastic, well done you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk).
I've saved an access token to `token.txt`. Using this, can you write a script that lists movies?

**tl;dr**: Yes.

Very impressive.
